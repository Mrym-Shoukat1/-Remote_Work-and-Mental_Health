There is a relationship between work location (remote, hybrid, or onsite) and stress levels (low, medium, or high). If the correlation is positive, it means that as more people work remotely, their stress levels tend to increase

Reason: Remote employees often report higher stress levels than those in office settings, mainly due to social isolation, work-life balance challenges, and communication issues. However, experiences vary, and some may find remote work less stressful than traditional offices.

# Summary of Remote Work and Mental Health

The analysis shows that employees aged 25-34 and 45-54 are more likely to work remotely, and there is a clear link between work location and stress levels. Remote employees often feel more stress due to issues like social isolation and work-life balance, although some find remote work less stressful. Industries such as Finance, IT, and Healthcare are leading in remote work, often filled by experienced professionals in roles like Project Managers, Designers, and HR. Stress levels vary significantly across different work arrangements, highlighting how the work environment affects employee well-being. Additionally, work hours generally increase with age, especially after 35, even though there is a temporary dip at that age.
